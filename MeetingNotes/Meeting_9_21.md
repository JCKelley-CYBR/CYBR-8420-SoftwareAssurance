A discussion of refining of our group's understanding of the perspective within the assignment "Requirements for Software Security Engineering".

Mitchell and Daniel discussed details of the scope of their individual use case and misuse case diagram.
The group discusses definitions of in/out of scope ideas for the misuse case diagram.

Aaron rescopes "haveIbeenpwned" to two/multi-factor authentication for access to KeePassXC.

Josh and Aaron discuss rewriting the usecases away from specifics cases and to be more general.

Mitchell raises a point that we need to retain a certain level of specificity in software features definition.

Group discussion of if secure writing and syncing of password is in scope, group understanding of the project assignment evolves from selecting features currently present in the Open Source Software application and evaluating them for security, to view the requirements as a company with the perspective of evaluating the software for adoption.

Redefined the assigned portions of the project assignment as below:
- Use Credentials - Josh
- Export/Backup Database - Mitchell
- Share Passwords within Organization - Daniel
- Authenticate to Application - Neil
- Password Generation - Aaron

Group will reconvene Sunday prior to assignment submission for review and completion of rest of assignment.
