## Code Review

### 1. Introduction

### 2. Code Review Strategy
The manual code review strategy for KeePassXC is as follows:
1. Selection of Common Weaknesses and Enumerations (CWEs) based on relevance to identified weaknesses/flaws within KeePassXC.
2. CWEs will be divided between group members during the manual review process.
3. Automated tools will then be employed against the KeePassXC respoitory (develope branch).
4. Selected CWEs will dictate the areas of concern from the automated test results.
5. Results will be investigated related to the selected CWEs and the automated scan results.
### 3. Automated Scan Strategy
The automated scan strategy adopted by the team for this project was as follows:
1. Each member uses an unique automated scanning tool on the KeePassXC repository.
2. Results of these scans are to be stored in their individual respositories in the [CodeReview](https://github.com/JCKelley-CYBR/CYBR-8420-SoftwareAssurance/tree/main/CodeReview) folder.
3. After conducting all five automated scans, each group member will evaluate all automated scans for correlation to the selected CWEs. Any issues, or new discoverys, will be evaluated in our findings.
