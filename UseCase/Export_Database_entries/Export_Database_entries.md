### Description:
Each user of the KeePassXC application will create and maintain their own KDBX style database in which the user's usernames, passwords, associated URLs, and associated notes will be stored. In order to export this database, KeePassXC has built in functionality to do so in teh CSV or HTML formats. The security functionality of this of this operation will be determined by analyzing the  security requirements needed to maintain a secure environment. 
### Alignment Analysis:
I. Security requirements deemed necessary through the use/misuse case diagramming process are as follows:
* *Some stuff* - blah 

II. Security features included within KeePassXC in regards to prior requirements:
* *Feat* - blah
