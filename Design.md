## 1. Introduction
To mitigate all of the highest impact threates, all generated threats from TMT of highest priority were divided amongst the team and assessed for mitigations that already exist in the KeePassXC implementation. Each invidual threat review is listed as follows: (1) identification of the threat, (2) mitigation justification is given, (3) existing & implemented mitigations are listed, and (4) any gaps in identified threats and existing mitigations are highlighted.
