## Team Motivation
The interconnectivity of the mobile device provided fertile grounds for the Service-as-a-Product business model to grow unchecked, and in the last five years, Software-as-a-Service, eg. Adobe Cloud, Office 365, etc, has also seen an increase in popularity. For the individual, we now have more accounts over a larger variety of applications and services than ever before, a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Consequentially, password managers have seen a similar growth in popularity, not only in the enterprise environment, but also for the individual. These password managers provide convenience in exchange for a single point of failure. 

We identified the importance of security within password management software during our initial perusal of open source software, and shortlisted a number of open source projects that intersected with various proprietary password managers. After our initial discussion with Dr.Gandhi we settled on KeePassXC, a fairly popular and well maintained open source password manager with a health community of contributors.
## Open-Source Project Description

## Licensing Information

## Contributing
The KeePassXC team maintains a friendly community for project discussions on both [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!zUxwGnFkUyycpxeHeM:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) and [Libera chat](https://web.libera.chat/), but they ask that new feature requests and bug reports be filed through the issue tracker on their Github repository. KeePassXC also welcomes direct contributions, be it code, documentation or artistic work. KeePassXC's [Open Source Contribution Policy](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides a guideline for content and a [styleguide](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides) that they ask all pull requests to comply with. There is no official Contribution Agreement, and their Contribution Policy is to "accept good code that they can use from anyone", meaning as long as they judge the contribution as suitiable, functional, efficient and not restricted by licening issues, the team will accept it. Translations for KeepPassXC are managed via [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/keepassxc/keepassxc/), the KeePassXC team asks that contributors join an existing language team or request a new translation if there is not an existing one.
