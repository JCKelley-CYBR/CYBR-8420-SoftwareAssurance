## Contributing
The KeePassXC team maintains a friendly community for project discussions on both [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!zUxwGnFkUyycpxeHeM:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) and [Libera chat](https://web.libera.chat/), but they ask that new feature requests and bug reports be filed through the issue tracker on their Github repository. KeePassXC also welcomes direct contributions, be it code, documentation or artistic work. KeePassXC's [Open Source Contribution Policy](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides a guideline for content and a [styleguide](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides) that they ask all pull requests to comply with. There is no official Contribution Agreement, and their Contribution Policy is to "accept good code that they can use from anyone", meaning as long as they judge the contribution as suitiable, functional, efficient and not restricted by licening issues, the team will accept it. Translations for KeepPassXC are managed via [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/keepassxc/keepassxc/), the KeePassXC team asks that contributors join an existing language team or request a new translation if there is not an existing one.
