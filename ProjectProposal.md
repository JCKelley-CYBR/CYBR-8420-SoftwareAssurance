## Open-Source Project: KeyPass 

## Hypothetical Operation Environment
KeepassXC provides a highly flexible password management solution for individuals and organizations. Allowing both local, network, and cloud storage of encrypted password databases and database shares. The software is expected in any environement to provide adequate encryption to maintain the confidentiality of the database contents, proper password maintanence ensuring password integrity, and ease of access for authorized individuals to ensure high availability.

Our hypothetical situation is based on a Regional Managed Service Provider (MSP) whose job is to routinely log in remotely to hundreds of different environments and servers to conduct normal IT operations for their clientele. Due to the number of different credentials shared between technicians, the department wants to implement a local, open-source password management solution called KeepassXC. This software will be critical to daily operations, allowing authorized technicians to access client systems' usernames, passwords, URLs, IP addresses, and Notes. KeepassXC enables the MSP to save these credentials into an encrypted, locally stored database to protect its contents and offer high availability to authorized technicians. Implementing KeepassXC into our corporate environment would increase the speed at which technicians can find proper credentials, use these credentials to carry out normal business operations on client systems, and improve our overall security posture by reducing the potential mishandling of client system credentials. The implementation would allow technicians to use a password, key file, or hardware key to unlock the database. The organization will create a root database and database shares only, including the necessary client credentials to complete their job responsibilities following the principle of least privilege.
